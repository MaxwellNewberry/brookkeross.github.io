         	Like many others (I’m sure), I adore minimalism and it is definitely my go-to when it comes to aesthetic decisions. I like for art and design to be aesthetically pleasing without being crowded or overwhelming. Additionally, I think that minimalism is best from the audience's perspective. Minimalist design allows for the observer to focus on the content rather than be confused and distracted by the presentation. It seems like many nice-looking websites employ simple color palettes of greys and blues, so that is definitely on the table. However in regards to my personal taste, I honestly love warm, earth tones such as, olive green, mustard yellow, and burnt orange. Since I have not seen those applied to a ton of websites, maybe it is a good idea to stand out. I am thinking that my website would regularly have images on it though, so I’m wondering if the color palette needs to be neutral enough that it is not clashing with whatever images I include. I don’t have a ton of ideas, other than minimalism and well-done simplicity is really important to me. As I previously said I really want this to be a film blog, even though that is kinda irresponsible when I could be making something more professional/useful, nevertheless I love movies. So as far as content goes, I do have a few ideas for individual pages within the blog including, recommendations, reviews, and more like critical/technical type analysis. 

Design Concept, Rewritten - 10 February 2020
	One of my favorite tweets ever written in the history of that god-forsaken bird website goes, 
“Which is your favorite Miyazaki genre:
Very Cute :)
If You Hurt This Tree I Will Fucking Kill You
Horny For Planes, Again” 
	Given that I love Miyazaki and the themes his works communicate and I love nature, the unifying theme/metaphor chosen to inspire my website design concept is Studio Ghibli. There are several characteristics I associate with Miyazaki films that I would like to utilize in developing my vision, starting with their reverence for nature. Nearly every Miyazaki film emphasizes humanity’s need to respect and live in harmony with nature. Therefore many of the visual elements of the film contain beautiful natural landscapes and other imagery that is inspired by the natural world. An additional characteristic that, for me, defines Miyazaki movies and one which I would also like to translate into my visual design, is the way the movies make you feel. While it is really hard to be articulate about something as abstract as feelings Studio Ghibli movies communicate love in a way that transcends romance or friendship, they are optimistic, thoughtful and freeing. I think I can translate these concepts into my visual design by ensuring that it is beautiful, accessible, and unique. 
As far as specific elements that accomplish this desire, it is important for the majority of fonts to be clear and without overly complicated details, so that all users are capable of reading them. For a font that would make up the body text of my website I would prefer something that is simple, but overly business-like the way that Times New Roman is. The following fonts are some that I think would fit- Gamja Flower, Kalam, Caveat and Special Elite. I do love calligraphy, so if I were to splurge on one more elaborate font it would probably be something like Merienda One, Rochester, Pattya, Leckerli One, Petit Formal Script, and Sofia, which are a bit rounder and closer to cursive, but still easy to read. While keeping the majority of my text simple my website will be accessible, while the other fonts can both draw attention to the header and hopefully manifest the whimsical beauty of Miyazaki’s work. 
As far my color palette and layout, I would like them to emphasize Miyazaki’s love for nature and flight. In order to communicate this I believe it necessary to stick to natural, earth tones, and avoid anything outrageously bright. Since nature is often beautiful without intention, I think it would be meaningful to experiment with asymmetry without my layout. I, for whatever, find myself partial to more left aligned pieces, so I will likely be paying attention to the rule of thirds. I would love for my design to communicate “lightless”  in terms of weight (as opposed to color), as homage to Miyazaki’s love of flight, however I am unsure of how to manifest that.
